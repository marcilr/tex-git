\subsection{Repositories}
The purpose of Git is to manage a project, or a set of files, as
they change over time.  Git stores this information in a data
structure called a repository.\footnote{Understanding Git: Repositories,\\

A git repository contains, among other things, the following:

\begin{itemize}
  \item{A set of commit objects.}
  \item{A set of references to commit objects, called heads.}
\end{itemize}

\noindent The Git repository is stored in the same directory as
the project itself, in a subdirectory called \cmd{.git}.  Note
differences from central-repository systems like CVS or
Subversion:

\begin{itemize}
  \item{There is only one .git directory,
        in the root directory of the project.}
  \item{The repository is stored in files alongside the project.
        There is no central server repository.}
\end{itemize}

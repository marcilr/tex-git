\section{Repo}
``Repo is a repository management tool that we built on top of Git.
Repo unifies the many Git repositories when necessary, does the
uploads to a revision control system, and automates parts of the
development workflow.  Repo is not meant to replace Git, only to
make it easier to work with Git in the context of Android.  The
\cmd{repo} command is an executable Python script that you can put
anywhere in your path.  In working with source files, you will use
Repo for across-network operations.  For example, with a single
Repo command you can download files from multiple repositories
into your local working directory.''\footnote{Developing -- \href{http://source.android.com/source/developing.html}{http://source.android.com/source/developing.html}}

\noindent \FIXME{The above \cmd{repo} quote has been heavily modified.
Need to rewrite with original verbage.}
